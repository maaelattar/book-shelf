## Reflection

This is a full stack app built with MERN stack it implements CRUD features for book class (or schema) but it lacks some features such as:

- User authentication
- Edition and deletion authorization for owner of the book
- Adding tags for books

and so on...

Right now any user can view books list, book details, create a new book, edit existing book and delete a book

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are:

- Front-End

  - React
  - React-Router-Dom 5.2
  - TailwindCSS
  - Axios

- Back-End:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB
